I mentor prospect students at Founders and Coders. You can also find me at various meetups, such as London Node.js User Group, TAQFull(Technology, Agility & Quality), and London Tech Ladies.

I am committed to building software, tackling challenges and achieving goals. My objective is to join a friendly team and work towards clever and elegant solutions.
